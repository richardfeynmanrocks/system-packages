#+TITLE: System Packages
#+LANGUAGE: en

This is a fork that adds some functionality to ~system-packages~ and has saner defaults.
- Packages are ensured via the package manager, not ~executable-find~.
- Packages are interacted with synchronously, as most package managers cannot handle multiple package install commands at the same time. 

Planned features: 
- Better support of language-specific package managers like ~pip~ or ~cargo~.
- Threading for package installs. 
- More expressive methods of ensuring packages?
- Some way to handle different package names on different platforms?

* Installation
